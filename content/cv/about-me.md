I am the third of six sons. Although I was born in Trenton, New Jersey, I am from Dover, Delaware. I am proud to say that I am a product of the [Capital School District](https://www.capital.k12.de.us/) as a member of [Dover High's](https://doverhigh.capital.k12.de.us/) amazing class of 1999.

I graduated from [Morehouse College](http://morehouse.edu/) in 2003 with a degree in political science. A few weeks after graduation, I began working towards my PhD in political science at the [University of Rochester](https://www.sas.rochester.edu/psc/), which I earned in 2008.

Now, I am back at Morehouse as an Associate Professor in the political science department. The bulk of my research is focused on black agenda setting -- how do you get Congress to pay attention to black issues? Currently, I am completing a book manuscript that examines 20th century black politics through the lens of bill sponsorship in Congress. I argue that a narrow form of black political empowerment (more black faces in high places) undermined efforts at achieving black liberation.

Outside of work, I do stuff with my wife and two children; I spread the gospel of [N.K. Jemisin's](http://nkjemisin.com/) greatness; and give serious thought to playing my [Lord of the Rings card game](https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game/) (but I don't actually play).
